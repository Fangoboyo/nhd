    Iran has continued to produce nuclear weapons to equip their army for War. Iranâ€™s nuclear production started to get
    out of hand, leading to the sanctions that minimized imports/exports, lowered the amount of nuclear weapons, and
    prompted other nations to stop oil trading with them. The starting of the sanctions was in 1979, following the U.S
    Embassy in Tehran. Several administrations had aided the U.S with the powerful sanctions.

    But, what exactly are sanctions? Sanctions are mostly financial penalties that usually target the economy of a
    specific country. The sanctions may be imposed due to the excessive production of an item, in this case, the nuclear
    weapons constructed by Iran.
