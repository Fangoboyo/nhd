    <h1 class="title">US Imposing Sanctions on Iran</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">The US imposed numerous sanctions on Iran for various different
      political reasons from 1979 until present day.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="has-text-centered is-size-5"> Introduction</p>
    <br>
    <p class="is-size-10 has-text-centered	has-text-weight-normal">The economic and social
      impact of nuclear proliferation in 1979 by a specific country such as Iran with a long history of civil unrest,
      engages in a war and decides to use its nuclear strength in such a war, can have tragic and grave consequences
      to the community. The irreparable damage caused by the devastating nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at
      the end of World War II is a black swan event in history. In response to Iran’s continued nuclear proliferation
      activities, the United States and other countries imposed sanctions to restrict Iran and prevent its progress in
      prohibited nuclear activities. These sanctions were designed to regulate Iran’s prohibited nuclear and missile
      programs, directly or indirectly impact the Iranian economy in a manner that helps curb its nuclear activities;
      and encourages Iran to constructively engage in discussions with the countries that have imposed sanctions to
      fulfill its obligations. The sanctions had several impacts such as a declining trend of Iranian exports from oil
      products, inflation, economic recession, a plunging valuation of Iranian Rial, increased smuggling, rising
      unemployment, deteriorating trade relations with the neighboring countries, shortages of medical supplies and
      isolation from the international community. Irrespective of the grave consequences that Iran had to face due to
      its nuclear activities, the United States sanctions set a precedent that unregulated production and use of
      nuclear energy by any country will not be taken lightly or go unpunished. These sanctions have helped maintain
      the balance of power in the world.</p>
