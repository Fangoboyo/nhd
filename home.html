      <p class="subtitle has-text-primary-light">The US imposed numerous sanctions on Iran for various different
        political reasons from 1979 until present day.
      <p class="is-size-5 has-text-centered	has-text-weight-normal has-text-primary-light">The economic and social
        impact of nuclear proliferation in 1979 by a specific country such as Iran with a long history of civil unrest,
        engages in a war and decides to use its nuclear strength in such a war, can have tragic and grave consequences
        to the community. The irreparable damage caused by the devastating nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at
        the end of World War II is a black swan event in history. In response to Iran’s continued nuclear proliferation
        activities, the United States and other countries imposed sanctions to restrict Iran and prevent its progress in
        prohibited nuclear activities. These sanctions were designed to regulate Iran’s prohibited nuclear and missile
        programs, directly or indirectly impact the Iranian economy in a manner that helps curb its nuclear activities;
        and encourages Iran to constructively engage in discussions with the countries that have imposed sanctions to
        fulfill its obligations. The sanctions had several impacts such as a declining trend of Iranian exports from oil
        products, inflation, economic recession, a plunging valuation of Iranian Rial, increased smuggling, rising
        unemployment, deteriorating trade relations with the neighboring countries, shortages of medical supplies and
        isolation from the international community. Irrespective of the grave consequences that Iran had to face due to
        its nuclear activities, the United States sanctions set a precedent that unregulated production and use of
        nuclear energy by any country will not be taken lightly or go unpunished. These sanctions have helped maintain
        the balance of power in the world.</p><br>
