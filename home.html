</h1><p id="desc_title">The US imposed numerous sanctions on Iran for various different political reasons from 1979 until present day.
</p><br/><div id="maint"><p id="ilwn"><strong>Introduction</strong></p></div><div id="iik8o"><p id="ifuq">The economic and social impact of nuclear proliferation in 1979 by a specific country such as Iran with a long history of civil unrest, engages in a war and decides to use its nuclear strength in such a war, can have tragic and grave consequences to the community. The irreparable damage caused by the devastating nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II is a black swan event in history. In response to Iran’s continued nuclear proliferation activities, the United States and other countries imposed sanctions to restrict Iran and prevent its progress in prohibited nuclear activities. These sanctions were designed to regulate Iran’s prohibited nuclear and missile programs, directly or indirectly impact the Iranian economy in a manner that helps curb its nuclear activities; and encourages Iran to constructively engage in discussions with the countries that have imposed sanctions to fulfill its obligations. The sanctions had several impacts such as a declining trend of Iranian exports from oil products, inflation, economic recession, a plunging valuation of Iranian Rial, increased smuggling, rising unemployment, deteriorating trade relations with the neighboring countries, shortages of medical supplies and isolation from the international community.  Irrespective of the grave consequences that Iran had to face due to its nuclear activities, the United States sanctions set a precedent that unregulated production and use of nuclear energy by any country will not be taken lightly or go unpunished. These sanctions have helped maintain the balance of power in the world.
