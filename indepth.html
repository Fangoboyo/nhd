    <p class="is-size-10 has-text-centered">Which administrations helped with the process of imposing sanctions on Iran?</p>
    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-centered">There were plenty of administrations that helped stop the nuclear production by Iran. The Carter Administration, which President Carter imposed a series of sanctions, beginning with a ban on Iranian oil imports, followed by blocking billions of dollars in Iranian government assets in the United States. The Regean Administration also imposed increasing restrictions on exports to Iran of dual-use items that could be adapted for military use. In the Clinton Administration, Congress had passed the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act, to convince foreign companies not to invest in Iran's oil and gas industry, the main source of the government's income. The Bush Administration had wanted the United States to issue a series of orders to freeze the assets of firms and individuals said to be involved in Iran's support for terrorism. The Obama Administration had passed the Divestment Act, which among other things targeted the supply of refined petroleum products sent to Iran. After years of failed diplomatic efforts to stop Iran from creating nuclear weapons, The United Nations and European officials had decided to help the US with the case. The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 was passed, which targeted transport and insurance of Iranian oil.</p>

    <p class="is-size-10 has-text-centered">Why did the US impose sanctions on Iran?</p>
    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-centered">The US started to impose sanctions in 1979 when the US Embassy was seized, and 1981 people were taken hostage. Because of this, a sanction was placed on Irans oil imports which means that it was banned. The US also imposed sanctions on Iran because of Iran's support in terrorism. The US were unhappy with the enourmous amount of nuclear weapons constructed by Iran, and decided to impose sanctions onto them to stop the nuclear production.</p>
